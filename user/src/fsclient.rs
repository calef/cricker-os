//! **The FS-service client** (milestone 32 phase 2): opens a file through a granted directory
//! capability and proves the whole stack end to end.
//!
//! This is the program a milestone-31 shell will one day be. It holds an endpoint to the FS server
//! and nothing that names the server, the block server, or the disk. That endpoint IS its directory
//! capability: it can open names the server resolves under the bound directory, and it can open
//! nothing else, because there is no global namespace to reach into. It reads the `motd` the image
//! ships with, then writes a pattern to `scratch` and reads it back, and reports the `motd` head
//! plus a success sentinel. Any failed check panics, which faults, which fails the waiting test.
//!
//! # Capability contract (notes/fs-server.md, notes/abi.md §4)
//! - **slot 0**: the file-service endpoint, `WRITE` (this is the directory capability; the client
//!   `CALL`s here).
//! - **slot 1**: the report endpoint, `WRITE`.
//! - **[`FILE_VA`]**: the page shared with the FS server (a name out, file bytes both ways).
