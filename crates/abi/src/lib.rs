//! **The syscall boundary, as a single artifact.**
//!
//! The kernel and every user program depend on this crate, so the ABI is *one thing* rather than
//! two files that agree by luck. If it changes, both sides fail to compile, which is the entire
//! point: a boundary that can drift silently is not a boundary.
//!
//! # The surface is three calls, and that is deliberate
//!
//! DECISIONS.md §4 rule 3: *the syscall surface stays narrow and explicit. It is a boundary, not
//! a habit.* And §10 chose capabilities, which is what makes three enough:
//!
//! ```text
//!   exit(code)                              you always have authority over yourself
//!   yield()                                 likewise
//!   invoke(cap, method, a0, a1, a2)         EVERYTHING ELSE
//! ```
//!
//! There is no `open`. No `read`. No `write`. No `fork`. **A process can only act on things it
//! was handed**, and `invoke` is how it acts on them.
//!
//! `exit` and `yield` are plain syscalls rather than invocations on a TCB capability, and the
//! reason is worth stating: **a capability is authority over something *else*.** You do not need
//! to be granted the right to stop running.
//!
//! # The register convention
//!
//! ```text
//!   x8  syscall number
//!   x0  capability slot        (for invoke)
//!   x1  method
//!   x2  arg0
//!   x3  arg1
//!   x4  arg2
//!
//!   x0  return: >= 0 is a result, < 0 is an `Error`
//! ```
//!
//! `x8` for the number is Linux's aarch64 convention, and there is no reason to be different.
