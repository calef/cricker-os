# cricker-os: Architecture Decisions

Decisions made 2026-07-12, before any code was written. Each entry records what we
chose, what we rejected, and why. Revisit these deliberately, not accidentally.

## 1. Target architecture: aarch64

Chosen over x86_64 and RISC-V.

x86_64 has the deepest pool of tutorials, but a large fraction of what it teaches is
Intel history (real mode, the A20 line, segmentation ghosts, PIC-vs-APIC) rather than
operating system concepts. RISC-V is the cleanest architecture to learn on, but it is
the *hardest* of the three to actually get onto silicon: peripheral documentation for
the JH7110-class SoCs is thin.

aarch64 gives a clean exception model (EL0/EL1/EL2/EL3), a sane MMU, an excellent
bare-metal community, and real hardware at the end of the road (Raspberry Pi). The dev
machine is also ARM, so kernel assembly and host assembly are the same instruction set.

## 2. Primary target: QEMU `virt`, Raspberry Pi as a later port

The QEMU `virt` machine has a PL011 UART, a GIC interrupt controller, and virtio
devices, all well-specified. Boots in a second, debuggable with GDB, scriptable in
tests.

The Raspberry Pi port is a deliberate later milestone, not an afterthought. It is the
moment the hardware abstraction layer gets tested for real, and it will reveal exactly
which assumptions were secretly QEMU-shaped.

## 3. Use the crate ecosystem

`aarch64-cpu` for system-register access, `tock-registers` for typed MMIO. Not
hand-rolled `asm!` and raw volatile pointer writes.

Time goes to kernel concepts (memory, scheduling, syscalls, filesystems), not to
debugging typos in ARM system-register encodings that a crate would have caught at
compile time.

## 4. Kernel shape: monolithic, deferred, with two cheap rules

We are NOT speculatively trait-ifying every subsystem to "keep the microkernel door
open." That builds the wrong abstraction before the requirements are known, and taxes
every file for a door we may never walk through.

Instead, two rules that cost almost nothing and preserve the real option:

1. **A driver never reaches into a kernel global.** It gets what it needs passed in.
2. **The syscall surface stays narrow and explicit.** It is a boundary, not a habit.

## 5. Execution model: preemptive threads with real stacks

Rejected: async/await cooperative multitasking (where the Philipp Oppermann blog series
ends).

The reason is a hard ceiling, not a matter of taste. A userspace process is an arbitrary
ELF binary. It has its own stack, it never yields, and it will loop forever because we
will write a bug. Under cooperative scheduling, one bad user program hangs the machine
permanently. Real user mode *requires* per-thread stacks, a context switch that saves and
restores the register file, and timer-driven preemption. Async doesn't defer that work,
it forecloses it.

Async can come back later, in userspace, on top of real threads, exactly the way a real
OS lets a program run Tokio. Nothing is given up.

## 6. SMP: single-core, refactor when it hurts

Boot CPU 0 only. Globals and a big lock are fine for now.

We explicitly considered shaping per-CPU data structures up front as cheap insurance,
and declined. Feeling the pain that created per-CPU structures is itself a legitimate
way to learn why they exist. Cost: a scheduler rewrite later. Accepted knowingly.

## 7. Testing: QEMU harness + host-testable crates, from commit one

A custom test harness boots the kernel in QEMU, runs tests, and exits with a status code
`cargo test` understands. Separately, pure logic (allocator algorithms, page-table math,
scheduling policy, filesystem parsing) lives in crates that compile for the *host*, so
most tests run in milliseconds with no emulator.

Front-loads about a day. Prevents a year of debugging by `println!`.

## 8. Process model / syscall ABI: DEFERRED to a hard decision point

Unix-like (fds, fork/exec) versus capability-based (seL4/Fuchsia-shaped) is genuinely
undecided, on purpose. Milestones 1-6 do not touch the syscall boundary, and every
kernel builds them roughly the same way, so the deferral is free until it isn't.

**Milestone 7 (user mode) is a hard decision point.** When we get there we stop, look at
what we've built, and choose deliberately. This deferral is a plan, not a drift. If we
find ourselves hacking in a syscall without having had that conversation, the plan has
failed.

## 9. Locking: IrqSafeMutex, plus a discipline

Decided 2026-07-13, before milestone 5 brings interrupts.

**The problem.** A plain spinlock in a kernel that takes interrupts is a guaranteed hang.
On **one core**: kernel code takes the lock, a timer interrupt fires, the handler tries to
take the same lock, and spins forever waiting for code that cannot run until the handler
returns. Not a race. Not "under load." A deterministic deadlock the moment the timing
lines up. SMP makes it worse; single-core does not save us.

**The decision: A + B.**

**A. Every kernel lock is an `IrqSafeMutex`** (`kernel/src/sync.rs`). It masks IRQs on
acquire and **restores the previous state** on release. This is Linux's
`spin_lock_irqsave`.

**B. Interrupt handlers do not allocate.** They acknowledge, record what happened, and
defer the real work to normal context. This keeps the interrupts-off window short, which is
what makes A's cost acceptable.

### Rejected: per-CPU reserve pools

Considered, and it turned out to be **an answer to a different question**. Per-CPU page
caches (Linux's PCP lists) exist for *scalability* and *cache locality*, not interrupt
safety: Linux still wraps them in `local_irq_save`. They do not solve this deadlock. They
belong to the SMP conversation (§6), where the problem is lock *contention*, not deadlock.

We also confirmed A+B is genuinely sufficient rather than a compromise. The only handler
that ever needs to allocate is the page fault handler, and:

> **Kernel memory is never demand-paged.** Kernel pages are mapped eagerly. A page fault
> taken from EL1 is a bug and is fatal (which is already true).

So every allocating fault comes from EL0, whose context held no kernel locks, because it
cannot. Nothing is left that needs a reserve pool.

### The rules

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| All kernel locks are `IrqSafeMutex` | A bare spinlock is a deadlock waiting for a schedule |
| **Acquire: mask IRQs, *then* take the lock** | The other order leaves a window holding the lock with IRQs live |
| **Release: drop the lock, *then* restore IRQs** | The other order leaves the same window, from the other side |
| **Restore, never blindly enable** | A lock taken inside a handler must not unmask IRQs on release |
| Keep critical sections short | Interrupts are off for the whole of it |
| Never allocate while holding a lock | Nested acquisition, and it makes the window long |
| Never `wfi`/`wfe` or block while holding a lock | Interrupts are off. You will not wake up. |
| Two locks? Define a global order, always take them in it | Otherwise AB-BA deadlock, which is a *real* race and far nastier |
| Interrupt handlers record and defer; they do not do work | Keeps the IRQ-off window short |
| **The panic/fault path breaks the console lock** | Faulting mid-`println!` would otherwise deadlock in the handler and lose the one message that mattered |

The last one is `console::force_unlock()`, called at the top of the panic handler and the
fatal exception path. Linux does the same and calls it `bust_spinlocks`.

### The ordering rule is now enforced, not merely written down

We wrote "define a global order and always take them in it" and then relied on remembering.
Now every lock carries a **rank**, and `IrqSafeMutex::lock` asserts:

> **You may only acquire a lock strictly LOWER than everything you currently hold.**

If every acquisition strictly decreases, a **cycle is unrepresentable**. Not unlikely.
Impossible. It destroys the circular-wait Coffman condition outright (notes/deadlock.md),
which is *prevention*, not detection: Linux's `lockdep` builds a dependency graph at runtime
and hunts for cycles; this costs three instructions and cannot be wrong. FreeBSD (WITNESS) and
Solaris use the same mechanism.

```
  50  HEAP, SLAB      the allocators
       |
  30  FRAMES, RAM     the physical memory map
       |
  10  CONSOLE         the leaf: everyone may take it, it takes nothing
```

Two locks at the **same** rank may never nest (`R < R` is false), which is exactly right:
equal rank means we declared no order between them, so nesting would be picking one at random.

The nestings this permits are the ones that actually happen:

- **SLAB (50) → FRAMES (30)** — a size class runs dry and takes a page while holding its lock.
- **anything → CONSOLE (10)** — a panic prints while holding a lock. Which is *why* the console
  must be the leaf.

The panic path calls `sync::force_reset_ranks()` alongside `console::force_unlock()`. Panicking
while holding the console lock would otherwise trip the ranking assertion *inside the panic
handler* and lose the original message to a recursive panic. **The bookkeeping is a debugging
aid; it must never be the thing that stops us saying what went wrong.**

## Open design ideas

Not decisions yet. Proposals with real open questions, parked deliberately.

- [Microarchitecture-variant binaries](design/fat-binaries.md) — our targets straddle the
  ARMv8.0 / ARMv8.2 line (no LSE atomics on Cortex-A72, LSE on everything newer), and with
  no libc we can't lean on LLVM's `outline-atomics` to paper over it. Milestone 6 forces
  the kernel-atomics question; milestone 7 is where a fat userspace format would be
  decided. Feature detection via the `ID_AA64ISAR*_EL1` registers is worth building at
  milestone 2 regardless.

## Milestones

Each rung is independently demoable. The dividing line between "a Rust program that
boots" and "an operating system" is milestone 7.

| 8  | virtio-blk driver + read-only filesystem        | Drivers, DMA, block I/O                  |    |
| 9  | Processes: spawn, exit, wait                    | Process lifecycle                        |    |
| 10 | A userspace shell that runs other binaries      | Proof the whole stack works              |    |

Deliberately out of scope for v1: SMP, a writable filesystem, networking, a GUI,
dynamic linking, real hardware. Each multiplies debugging difficulty and none teaches
something the first ten don't already set up.
