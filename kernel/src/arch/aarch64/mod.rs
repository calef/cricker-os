/// emulation treats it as little more than a hint, so `loop { wfe() }` keeps translating
/// and executing, and a halted kernel burns **99.7% of a host CPU core**. We discovered
/// this the way you'd expect: eleven abandoned QEMU processes cooking the laptop overnight
/// at a combined 729%.
///
/// `wfi` waits for an *interrupt*, and QEMU implements it as an actual vCPU halt: the host
/// thread sleeps. An idle kernel becomes genuinely idle.
///
/// It is also the more correct instruction for what we mean. We are not waiting for an
/// event from a sibling core. We are idling until something interrupts us, of which there
/// is currently nothing, which is exactly the point.
