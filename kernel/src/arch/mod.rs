//! The hardware abstraction boundary.
//!
//! Everything below this module is architecture-specific. Everything above it
//! should be portable. The rest of the kernel talks to the hardware only through
//! what is re-exported here.
//!
//! This is the single most important structural rule in the codebase, and the one
//! that is easiest to erode by accident. If you find yourself writing `asm!` or
//! touching a system register outside `arch/`, that's the bug. See
//! notes/portability.md.
