//! `no_std`  — there is no operating system beneath us, because we *are* the
//!             operating system. `std`'s `File::open` would make a syscall, and
//!             there is nobody to answer it. We link only `core`.
//!
//! `no_main` — in a normal program `main` is not the first thing to run. The C
//!             runtime (`crt0`) sets up the stack, initializes libc, builds `argv`,
//!             and *then* calls `main`. There is no libc here and nobody has set up
//!             a stack, so there can be no `main`. Our entry point is `_start`, in
//!             assembly, and it sets up the stack itself.
//!
