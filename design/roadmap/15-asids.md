# 15. Tagged address spaces (ASIDs)

**Status: BUILT.**

**In brief.** 16-bit ASIDs, generation/rollover; stop flushing the whole EL1 TLB per switch

**Why it matters.** perf the real-workload path needs on real silicon. **Built** (8-bit fixed bitmap, no rollover: milestone 14's bounds made generations unnecessary; notes/asids.md)

**Deliverable.** Give each address space an ASID so a context switch stops doing `tlbi vmalle1is`
(discard every EL1 translation, machine-wide) and instead flushes nothing.

**Why.** `mmu::set_ttbr0` does the sledgehammer flush today and says so: "no ASIDs yet ... every
address space uses ASID 0 ... ASIDs are the fix." A self-contained exercise in ASID allocation and,
more interestingly, ASID *reuse* (there are only so many; a real system recycles them and must flush
exactly the reclaimed one). It has no measurable payoff on QEMU, which does not model TLB cost, so it
is here for the mechanism, and as the honest prerequisite for reasoning about the
Spectre/address-space-switch cost the discussion raised. You cannot measure that cost while every
switch already flushes the world.

**Detail.** Standard aarch64 (ASID in TTBRx, `TCR_EL1.A1`); kernel/src/arch/aarch64/mmu.rs carries
the deferral.
