# Post-v1 milestone roadmap

The eleven milestones in DECISIONS.md were the plan, and they are done. This is the roadmap past
them. It began (see the git history of this file) as an uncommitted `design/` proposal drawn from the
architecture discussion comparing Windows NT, macOS/XNU, and Linux. It now has a **committed
destination**: DECISIONS §14, a verified-Rust capability microkernel that runs real workloads. That
commitment re-ordered this list and resolved two of the forks it used to end with.

Three facts shape the whole list.

**cricker-os already _is_ most of the clean-slate recommendation.** No fork (explicit `Spawn`
endowment: reading one literal tells you a process's whole authority). Share-not-move frames with
rights narrowing at send. Endpoint-only naming, no way to name a receiver. Memory safety as a
language property. So this roadmap is not "adopt the principles." It is "close the specific gaps
between the principles and this code," and the gaps are few.

**Understanding is the method, not a cap on ambition** (CLAUDE.md). The way we work is unchanged:
write it together, explain the hardware, write the notes. What changed with §14 is that the work now
serves a destination (the demonstrator), so a milestone earns its place by moving toward a *verified
core running real confined workloads*, not only by what it teaches in isolation.

**Verify inward from the capability core.** §14 makes verification the goal, and the frontier is the
pure-logic §7 crates. The `caps` model is proved already (`script/verify`, notes/verification.md);
IPC and the MMU invariants are next. This threads through the list rather than being one milestone.

## The milestones

| #  | Milestone | What it delivers | Serves §14 by |
|----|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| 12 | Call/Reply IPC: a one-shot reply capability | Reply-to-caller as a kernel guarantee. **Built, §12.** | the IPC the TCB must get right |
| 13 | Capability revocation + untyped reclamation | Unmap a page from every holder; reclaim a region safely. **Built (frame scope), §13.** | safe teardown, a TCB property |
| 18 | Verify the capability core, then spread inward | Machine-checked proofs of `caps`, then IPC, then MMU isolation | **the verification itself.** `caps` proved; IPC and MMU next |
| 14 | Kernel objects from untyped: remove the kernel heap | Retype TCBs, endpoints, page tables; delete the kernel heap | **critical path:** a verifiable kernel cannot allocate |
| 15 | Tagged address spaces (ASIDs) | 16-bit ASIDs, generation/rollover; stop flushing the whole EL1 TLB per switch | perf the real-workload path needs on real silicon |
| 16 | Real hardware + SMMU-backed driver isolation | Port to an IOMMU-backed machine; confine driver DMA in silicon | isolation in hardware, under real workloads |
| 19 | Run a real workload | A native-ABI workload first; Linux-compat or VM hosting later | **the "runs real workloads" half** of the thesis |
| 17 | Multikernel-leaning scheduler (research, optional) | Partition the shared thread table and endpoints | optional; not on the thesis path |

The order §14 sets: **verify the core and make it verifiable first** (18 and 14, the thesis), then
the road to running real workloads on real machines (15, 16, 19), with the multikernel work (17) left
as optional research. The competitor ambition stays parked (see the end of this file). Several
milestones already have their design worked out; the blocks below point at it.

### 12. Call/Reply IPC: a one-shot reply capability

**Built (milestone 12); see DECISIONS §12 and notes/ipc-naming.md.** The rest of this block is the
proposal it was built from.

**Deliverable.** A kernel-minted, single-use reply capability handed to a server on a `Call`, so it
can answer *whoever* called without being individually wired to them, and can answer exactly once.

**Why first.** Small, self-contained, and it retires a real wart: request/reply currently burns two
endpoints, and the console server is correct only *by convention* (it is single-threaded and IPC is
synchronous rendezvous), not by construction. The moment a server serves clients it was not wired
to, or a thread pool shares a reply path, the convention breaks.

**Prior art.** Mach's `send-once` right (it had this in the 1980s); seL4's `Reply` cap minted on
`Call`, with a call chain that also enables priority donation.

**Detail.** DECISIONS.md "Open design ideas" (Call/Reply) and notes/ipc-naming.md already work the
functional and safety triggers. It widens the §4 syscall surface (a `Call` method, a `Reply`
object), so it is a real decision, not a speculative add. This milestone turns that entry into code
and gives it its own numbered §.

### 13. Capability revocation + untyped reclamation

**Built (milestone 13), scoped to frame revocation; see DECISIONS §13.** The full derivation tree is
deferred, the way the argument earlier in this file predicted: revoke-all-derivatives serves the
reclamation triggers, and subtree granularity waits for a driver. The rest of this block is the
proposal it was built from.

**Deliverable.** A capability-derivation tree and a recursive `revoke` that unmaps an object from
every holder, so authority can be retracted from a live peer and a page can finally be reclaimed.

**Why.** The deepest thing left in the capability model, and it unblocks everything about
reclamation. `untyped::destroy` already exists, dead, as a tripwire: today frames are spend-only and
never reused, which is the *only* reason teardown's dangling mappings are safe rather than a
use-after-free.

**Prior art.** seL4's CDT plus recursive revoke, a first-class kernel object there.

**Blocking precondition.** DECISIONS.md "Open design ideas" (revocation) and
notes/capability-lifecycle.md state the invariant this must not break: **no reclamation of any kind
until revocation lands.** This milestone is that work, and the precondition is why it comes before
14.

### 14. Kernel objects from untyped: remove the kernel heap

**Deliverable.** Retype TCBs, endpoints, and page tables out of untyped memory, the way milestone 11
already does for user pages, and delete the kernel heap and slab.

**Why.** This finishes §10's deferred axis. Milestone 11 stopped the kernel allocating for *user*
memory; the kernel's own objects still come from its heap. It is also the real prerequisite for the
"small enough to verify" endgame: seL4's proof leans on a kernel that never allocates. Biggest item
here, and the seL4 long tail by reputation.

**On the critical path (§14).** The gate this used to sit behind ("is verifiability actually the
goal?") is resolved: it is. So this is no longer an optional purity win. A verifiable kernel cannot
allocate dynamically, so removing the heap is a prerequisite for verifying the kernel at scale rather
than only its pure-logic crates. It still also buys the smaller payoff on its own terms: the
kernel-heap-exhaustion class disappears entirely.

### 15. Tagged address spaces (ASIDs)

**Deliverable.** Give each address space an ASID so a context switch stops doing `tlbi vmalle1is`
(discard every EL1 translation, machine-wide) and instead flushes nothing.

**Why.** `mmu::set_ttbr0` does the sledgehammer flush today and says so: "no ASIDs yet ... every
address space uses ASID 0 ... ASIDs are the fix." A self-contained exercise in ASID allocation and,
more interestingly, ASID *reuse* (there are only so many; a real system recycles them and must flush
exactly the reclaimed one). It has no measurable payoff on QEMU, which does not model TLB cost, so it
is here for the mechanism, and as the honest prerequisite for reasoning about the
Spectre/address-space-switch cost the discussion raised. You cannot measure that cost while every
switch already flushes the world.

**Detail.** Standard aarch64 (ASID in TTBRx, `TCR_EL1.A1`); kernel/src/arch/aarch64/mmu.rs carries
the deferral.

### 16. Real hardware + SMMU-backed driver isolation

**Deliverable.** Port to hardware with an IOMMU in front of the device (Raspberry Pi 4 class, or
virtio-pci behind QEMU's SMMU) and confine driver DMA with the SMMU's stage-2, behind or instead of
the software shadow ring.

**Why.** This is where the discussion's strongest pro-microkernel argument finally becomes true for
us. On QEMU `virt` there is no IOMMU over virtio-mmio, so driver isolation is real only because of
the shadow descriptor ring we wrote (notes/dma.md). Real hardware makes it real in silicon, and the
shadow ring becomes belt-and-suspenders rather than the sole defense. Keep the `Virtio` capability
shaped so it can sit behind either.

**Prior art.** design/driver-domains.md already works the principled version (a driver per VM,
cricker-os as an EL2 hypervisor, SMMU stage-2). Hardware-gated, and impossible under HVF.

### 17. Multikernel-leaning scheduler (research, optional)

**Deliverable.** Partition or replicate the two structures still shared under one `SCHED` lock (the
thread table and the endpoint array), toward per-core state with message-passing where a lock now
sits.

**Why.** The SMP work (§11) already went most of the way: per-CPU run queues, per-CPU current and
held-rank, cross-core placement by inbox-plus-SGI with no shared run-queue lock. What remains shared
is the thread table and endpoints. Barrelfish's multikernel (treat the machine as a distributed
system, message-passing between cores) is the honest research answer for NUMA and P/E asymmetry.
This is a direction, not a commitment: keeping the one lock is a perfectly honest choice at the
current scale, and worth saying so rather than feeling the machine is owed a message-passing thread
table.

### 18. Verify the capability core, then spread inward

**Green-lit and started; see DECISIONS §14 and notes/verification.md.** This is the verification
thesis as an actual work item rather than an aspiration.

**Deliverable.** Machine-checked proofs (Kani) of the security-critical logic, spreading inward from
the capability core. `crates/caps` is proved already: five harnesses covering "`derive` never widens
rights," "userspace cannot forge a right," and the subset order's reflexivity and transitivity, each
for *every* input rather than sampled cases (`script/verify`). Next, in order, IPC (the rendezvous
and the one-shot reply) and the MMU isolation invariants.

**Why here.** It is the differentiator (§14), and it is cheap to start: the §7 pure-logic crates
already compile for the host, and proofs live behind `#[cfg(kani)]` so they never touch an ordinary
build. It also interlocks with 14: proving properties *of the kernel* (not just its logic crates) at
scale wants a kernel that does not allocate.

**Prior art.** seL4 (Isabelle/HOL refinement, verified C) is the mountain; we took the tractable path
(bounded model checking, Rust). Verus is the deeper Rust option to revisit if a property needs
unbounded proof.

### 19. Run a real workload

**Deliverable.** The "runs real workloads" half of §14: a real, unverified program running in
confined userspace on the verified core. A **native-ABI** workload first (the leanest thing that
proves the point), with a Linux-compat personality or VM hosting as later, larger options.

**Why.** The thesis is not "a verified kernel" but "a verified kernel *that runs real workloads*."
This is the milestone that makes the second half true, and it is what a demonstrator ultimately shows.

**The sub-decision it carries.** What counts as the first "real workload," and by which ABI. Native
first keeps the kernel pure and the surface small. A Linux-compat personality (Starnix / gVisor /
WSL1 shape, a userspace server translating syscalls) is how a demonstrator eventually reaches
existing software, and it is where the parked competitor ambition would begin. VM hosting (seL4's
route) needs the EL2 work in design/driver-domains.md. Decide the first target before writing
compat code, so it stays scoped.

## One decision this roadmap still forces

§14 resolved the verification-endgame fork (verification *is* the goal) and converted the old "POSIX
posture" question into milestone 19's real-workload sub-decision (reach binds now that "real
workloads" is committed). What remains open:

- **When the demonstrator becomes a competitor, if ever.** §14 keeps a general-purpose competitor as
  an explicit *later optionality*, parked until the demonstrator earns it. The trigger to reopen it is
  concrete: a verified core that actually runs a real workload (milestone 19), plus a reason the
  world needs another OS that the demonstrator has by then proved. Until both hold, competitor-shaped
  work (broad driver coverage, a full Linux ABI, a package ecosystem) is out of scope, and saying so
  keeps the demonstrator from sliding into a second, unfinished Linux.

## The rival worth understanding, not building

eBPF is the strongest competing answer to the question this whole architecture asks: safe kernel
extension through *verification* rather than *isolation*, with no IPC cost. Worth reading as the
other fork. It does not undercut the thesis so much as relocate the cost: the eBPF verifier is itself
a large, subtle, repeatedly-CVE'd component, so "the verifier is the TCB" is its version of the
problem, not an escape from it. No milestone; a reading item.
